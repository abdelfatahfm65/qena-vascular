# Vascular Surgery

## Conceptual Framework

Vascular surgery is the branch of surgery concerned with disorders that compromise **arterial inflow**, **venous outflow**, or **vessel wall integrity**. Rather than treating vascular problems as isolated diseases, it is more accurate to view them as **disturbances in blood flow and vessel structure**—leading to **ischemia** (reduced perfusion), **venous hypertension** (impaired drainage and reflux), or **hemorrhage** (loss of containment).

<Callout>
**Unifying idea:** vascular pathology can usually be explained by  
**(1) altered flow** + **(2) vessel wall change** + **(3) tissue consequence**.
</Callout>

## Anatomical Foundations

### Vessel Wall Anatomy (What arteries and veins are made of)

All vessels share three concentric layers. Knowing what each layer does makes vascular pathology predictable—not just memorable.

- **Tunica intima**
  - Endothelial lining in direct contact with blood  
  - When healthy: smooth, anti-thrombotic surface  
  - When injured (atherosclerosis, instrumentation, trauma): triggers **platelet adhesion** and **thrombosis**

- **Tunica media**
  - Smooth muscle + elastic tissue (especially prominent in arteries)  
  - Maintains tone and mechanical strength  
  - Degeneration weakens the wall and contributes to **aneurysm formation**

- **Tunica adventitia**
  - Outer connective tissue layer  
  - Anchors the vessel to surrounding structures and contains small feeding vessels (**vasa vasorum**) in larger arteries  
  - In trauma, disruption may cause hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, or loss of structural support

**Clinical translation**
- **Thrombosis** often begins with endothelial injury + abnormal flow.
- **Aneurysms** reflect progressive loss of wall strength (especially media support).
- **Trauma** can disrupt any layer → bleeding, thrombosis, pseudoaneurysm, or AVF.

## Arterial System

Arteries deliver oxygenated blood under high pressure. In vascular surgery, arterial anatomy is most useful when organized into **segments**—because symptoms, pulses, and imaging findings often localize disease by level.

### Lower Limb Arterial Roadmap (High-yield)

#### 1) Aorto-iliac segment (inflow to the limb)
- **Abdominal aorta** → **common iliac arteries**
- **Common iliac** → **internal iliac** (pelvis) + **external iliac** (limb inflow)
- **External iliac** passes under the inguinal ligament → becomes the **common femoral artery**

<Callout>
**Anatomy-to-symptoms**
Aorto-iliac disease often produces proximal claudication (buttock/thigh) and weak femoral pulses because inflow to the entire limb is reduced.
</Callout>

#### 2) Femoropopliteal segment (main conduit across thigh and knee)
- **Common femoral artery** gives:
  - **Profunda femoris (deep femoral)**: major collateral supply to the thigh
  - **Superficial femoral artery (SFA)**: continues through adductor canal
- SFA becomes the **popliteal artery** behind the knee

#### 3) Infrapopliteal / tibial segment (outflow to the foot)
From the popliteal artery:
- **Anterior tibial artery** → continues as **dorsalis pedis** on the dorsum of the foot
- **Posterior tibial artery** → runs behind the medial malleolus to supply the plantar foot
- **Fibular (peroneal) artery** → important collateral pathway, especially in advanced disease

<Callout>
**Pulse landmarks you should know**
- **Femoral pulse:** groin (femoral triangle)  
- **Popliteal pulse:** deep in popliteal fossa  
- **Posterior tibial pulse:** behind the medial malleolus  
- **Dorsalis pedis pulse:** dorsum of foot, lateral to EHL tendon  
These points are “functional anatomy”—they help localize arterial disease clinically.

### Upper Limb Arterial Roadmap (Relevant for AVF and embolic disease)

- **Subclavian → axillary → brachial**
- **Brachial** divides into:
  - **Radial artery**
  - **Ulnar artery**

Upper-limb arterial anatomy becomes especially important when discussing **dialysis access (AVF)** and when assessing acute ischemia from embolic disease.

## Venous System

Veins return blood at low pressure—especially challenging in the lower limb where blood must travel upward against gravity. Effective venous return depends on:

- **Patent deep veins** (primary drainage pathway)
- **Competent valves** (prevent reflux)
- **Calf muscle pump** (propels blood proximally during walking)

### The “Two Systems + Perforators” Model

#### Deep venous system
- Located beneath deep fascia and accompanies arteries
- Responsible for most venous return
- Thrombosis here produces **DVT**, with risk of pulmonary embolism and long-term outflow obstruction

#### Superficial venous system
- Subcutaneous veins, most clinically relevant are:

**Great saphenous vein (GSV)**
- Medial foot → medial leg → medial thigh
- Drains into the femoral vein at the **saphenofemoral junction (SFJ)**

**Small saphenous vein (SSV)**
- Posterolateral foot → posterior calf
- Usually drains into the popliteal vein (saphenopopliteal region)

#### Perforator veins
- Connect superficial to deep veins
- Normal direction: **superficial → deep**
- Valve failure reverses flow → **venous hypertension**

<Callout>
**Why varicose veins are a hemodynamic problem**
Varicose veins typically reflect **reflux** (valvular failure) at junctions (SFJ/SSV) or perforators—not “weak veins” alone. Reflux raises venous pressure, producing edema, skin changes, and ulceration in advanced disease.

## Hemodynamics & Clinical Patterns (How anatomy becomes disease)

### Arterial ischemia: acute vs chronic

**Acute limb ischemia (ALI)**  
A sudden reduction in perfusion (embolus or acute thrombosis) causes rapid tissue threat because there is no time to develop collateral compensation.

**Chronic limb ischemia / CLTI (and CTI terminology in some curricula)**  
Progressive atherosclerosis gradually narrows inflow/outflow. Collaterals may partially compensate, so symptoms evolve—from claudication to rest pain and tissue loss.

<Callout>
**Key contrast**
- **Acute** ischemia is a *time-critical* perfusion failure.  
- **Chronic** ischemia is a *capacity/ reserve* problem where compensation eventually becomes insufficient.
</Callout>

### Aneurysmal disease: structural failure

An aneurysm is not simply a “wide artery.” It represents **loss of wall integrity** with risks that depend on location and size:
- **Rupture** (catastrophic hemorrhage)
- **Thrombus formation** with distal embolization
- Local compression (site-specific)

### Vascular trauma: hemorrhage + ischemia

Trauma may cause:
- Transection/laceration → hemorrhage
- Dissection/contusion → thrombosis and distal ischemia
- Partial wall injury → **pseudoaneurysm**
- Combined arterial + venous injury → **traumatic AVF**

### AVF: abnormal shunting

An arteriovenous fistula allows high-pressure arterial flow to enter the venous system:
- Venous dilation and arterialization
- Possible distal “steal” symptoms
- Large shunts may increase venous return and cardiac workload

### Venous disease: reflux vs obstruction

Most venous pathology can be grouped into:
- **Reflux (valvular failure)** → chronic venous insufficiency and varicosities
- **Obstruction (DVT / post-thrombotic changes)** → swelling, pain, venous hypertension, post-thrombotic syndrome

## How This Library Is Organized

This vascular surgery library applies the anatomy-and-flow framework across the following topics:

- **Acute Limb Ischemia (ALI)**
- **Chronic Limb Ischemia / CLTI / CTI**
- **Arterial Aneurysm**
- **Vascular Trauma**
- **Arteriovenous Fistula (AVF)**
- **Varicose Veins & Chronic Venous Insufficiency**
- **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)**

<Callout>
If you keep returning to three questions—**Where is the lesion? What is the mechanism? What does the tissue show?**—most vascular presentations become straightforward to interpret and manage.
