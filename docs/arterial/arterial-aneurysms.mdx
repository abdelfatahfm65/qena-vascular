# Arterial Aneurysms

---

## Definition

> **An arterial aneurysm** is a permanent, localized dilatation of an artery measuring **≥ 1.5 times** its normal diameter.

Aneurysms may involve:
- The **entire vessel wall** (true aneurysm)
- Or occur due to wall disruption (false aneurysm / pseudoaneurysm)

---

## Why it matters

Aneurysms are often **silent** but potentially **lethal**.

Major risks include:
- **Rupture → hemorrhagic shock**
- **Thrombosis**
- **Distal embolization**
- **Compression of adjacent structures**

> ⚠️ Many aneurysms are discovered incidentally.

---

## Classification

### By wall structure
- **True aneurysm**  
  (involves all 3 layers of the vessel wall)
- **False aneurysm (Pseudoaneurysm)**  
  (breach in the arterial wall with contained hematoma)

### By shape
- **Fusiform** – circumferential dilatation
- **Saccular** – focal outpouching

---

## Common sites

| Site | Notes |
|----|-----|
| **Abdominal aorta (AAA)** | Most common |
| **Popliteal artery** | Most common peripheral aneurysm |
| Femoral artery | Often iatrogenic |
| Iliac artery | Often associated with AAA |

## Etiology

- **Atherosclerosis** (most common)
- Smoking
- Hypertension
- Connective tissue disorders
- Trauma
- Infection (mycotic aneurysm)

---

## Clinical presentation

### Asymptomatic
- Most aneurysms are discovered incidentally

### Symptomatic
- Pulsatile mass
- Pain (expansion or impending rupture)
- Ischemic symptoms due to embolization
- Neurological symptoms from compression

---

## Diagnosis

### First-line investigations
- **Duplex ultrasound** – screening & follow-up
- **CT angiography (CTA)** – gold standard for planning

### Screening
- Men > 65 years with smoking history (AAA)

---

## Management principles

### Conservative
- Small, asymptomatic aneurysms
- Risk factor modification
- Regular imaging surveillance

### Indications for repair
- Symptomatic aneurysm
- Rapid expansion
- Size threshold exceeded
  - AAA ≥ **5.5 cm**
  - Popliteal aneurysm ≥ **2 cm**

---

## Treatment options

### Open surgical repair
- Aneurysm exclusion
- Graft interposition

### Endovascular repair
- EVAR / stent graft
- Less invasive
- Requires long-term surveillance

---

## Complications

- Rupture
- Distal embolization
- Thrombosis
- Graft infection
- Endoleak (EVAR)

---

## Key clinical pearls

- Popliteal aneurysms often present with **ischemia**, not rupture
- Always **screen for AAA** if popliteal aneurysm is found
- Smoking is the strongest modifiable risk factor
- Size and symptoms guide management

---

## Summary

- Aneurysms are often silent but dangerous
- Atherosclerosis is the main cause
- Ultrasound and CTA are key investigations
- Repair is indicated based on size and symptoms
