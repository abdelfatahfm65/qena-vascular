# Chronic Limb-Threatening Ischemia (CLTI)

> **CLTI** is the most severe clinical presentation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), characterized by **chronic ischemic rest pain**, **non-healing ulcers**, or **gangrene**, typically lasting **>2 weeks**, and associated with a high risk of limb loss.

---

## Why it matters

CLTI is not just a “leg problem”—it is a marker of **advanced systemic atherosclerosis**.

- High risk of **major amputation**
- High risk of **cardiovascular events** (MI / stroke)
- Management requires: **Best Medical Therapy + Revascularization when appropriate + Wound care**

---

## Etiology and risk factors

### Etiology
- Atherosclerosis (most common)
- Diabetes-related distal disease (tibial / pedal)
- End-stage renal disease (accelerated calcification)
- Less common: vasculitis, Buerger disease

### Major risk factors
- Smoking
- Diabetes mellitus
- Hypertension
- Dyslipidemia
- Chronic kidney disease
- Advanced age

---

## Clinical presentation

### Key features
- **Ischemic rest pain**
  - Often in the forefoot/toes
  - Worse at night, relieved by hanging the leg down
- **Non-healing ulcer**
  - Usually at pressure points (toes, heel, metatarsal heads)
- **Gangrene**
  - Dry (mummified) vs wet (infected/urgent)

> ⚠️ Infection + ischemia = limb-threatening emergency.

---

## Clinical severity classifications

These classifications are commonly used to describe **chronic limb ischemia** severity.  
In practice, **CLTI corresponds to advanced stages** (rest pain and/or tissue loss).

### Fontaine classification
- **Stage I:** Asymptomatic
- **Stage II:** Intermittent claudication  
  - **IIa:** mild claudication  
  - **IIb:** moderate–severe claudication
- **Stage III:** Ischemic rest pain
- **Stage IV:** Ulceration or gangrene

### Rutherford classification (chronic limb ischemia)
- **Category 0:** Asymptomatic
- **Category 1:** Mild claudication
- **Category 2:** Moderate claudication
- **Category 3:** Severe claudication
- **Category 4:** Ischemic rest pain
- **Category 5:** Minor tissue loss (small ulcers / focal gangrene, typically toes)
- **Category 6:** Major tissue loss (extensive gangrene or deep ulcer threatening the limb)

**Quick mapping**
- Claudication = **Rutherford 1–3** (≈ Fontaine II)
- Rest pain = **Rutherford 4** (≈ Fontaine III)
- Tissue loss = **Rutherford 5–6** (≈ Fontaine IV)

---

## Examination

- Skin: shiny, hair loss, cool limb, dependent rubor
- Ulcers: location, depth, necrosis, discharge
- Pulses: femoral → popliteal → DP/PT
- Capillary refill and temperature gradient
- Neurology: assess neuropathy (especially diabetics)


---

## Diagnosis

### Bedside physiologic tests
- **ABI (ankle–brachial index)**
  - Useful, but may be falsely elevated in diabetics/CKD due to calcification
- **Toe pressure / TBI**
  - More reliable in diabetics
- **TcPO₂** (when available): supports wound healing prediction

#### ABI classification (interpretation)
**ABI = ankle systolic pressure / brachial systolic pressure**

| ABI value | Interpretation |
|---:|---|
| **> 1.30** | **Non-compressible (calcified) arteries** → ABI may be falsely high |
| **1.00 – 1.29** | Normal |
| **0.91 – 0.99** | Borderline |
| **0.41 – 0.90** | PAD (mild–moderate) |
| **≤ 0.40** | Severe PAD (often associated with CLTI) |

<Callout type="warning" title="ABI pitfall in diabetes / CKD">
If **ABI > 1.30**, arteries may be **non-compressible** (medial calcification), so ABI can be **falsely reassuring**.  
Use **toe pressure / TBI** (and/or **TcPO₂** when available) to better assess perfusion.
</Callout>

### Imaging for planning revascularization
- **Duplex ultrasound**: first-line in many settings
- **CTA**: excellent for mapping inflow/outflow
- **MRA**: alternative when CTA not suitable
- **Angiography**: often done when proceeding to intervention

## Management overview

CLTI management should be **multidisciplinary**:
- Vascular team + podiatry/wound care + diabetes control + infection management

Think in 3 pillars:

1. **Best Medical Therapy (BMT)**
2. **Revascularization (when indicated and feasible)**
3. **Wound care / infection control**

---

## 1) Best Medical Therapy (BMT)

### Antiplatelet
- Aspirin or clopidogrel (choose per patient context)

### Statins
- High-intensity statin unless contraindicated

### Risk factor control
- Strict smoking cessation
- Diabetes control (HbA1c targets individualized)
- Blood pressure control
- Exercise where possible (often limited in CLTI)

### Pain control
- Rest pain can be severe; treat appropriately

> BMT reduces cardiovascular risk and improves long-term limb outcomes.

---

## 2) Revascularization

### Who needs revascularization?
- CLTI with rest pain / tissue loss **usually requires revascularization** if limb is salvageable and anatomy allows.

### Strategy (general)
- **Endovascular-first** is common (especially in high-risk patients)
- **Bypass surgery** is preferred in selected patients with:
  - Good vein conduit
  - Longer occlusions
  - Suitable target vessel
  - Acceptable operative risk

### Goals
- Restore straight-line flow to the foot (when possible)
- Support wound healing and relieve rest pain

---

## 3) Wound care and infection control

- Debridement when appropriate (timing depends on perfusion)
- Offloading (especially plantar ulcers)
- Culture-guided antibiotics if infected
- Treat osteomyelitis when suspected
- Coordinate revascularization + wound strategy

> ⚠️ Wet gangrene or spreading infection needs urgent surgical + vascular decision-making.

---

## When is primary amputation considered?

Primary major amputation may be appropriate when:
- Non-salvageable limb (extensive necrosis, non-reconstructable anatomy)
- Severe infection with systemic compromise
- Patient non-ambulatory with very limited expected benefit
- Revascularization not feasible or repeatedly failed

This should be a **shared decision** with patient and family.

---

## Key clinical pearls

- CLTI is a severe PAD stage with **high systemic risk**
- ABI may be misleading in diabetics → use toe pressures/TBI when possible
- Infection + ischemia is an emergency
- Always combine **BMT + revascularization (when appropriate) + wound care**

---

## Summary

- CLTI = chronic rest pain, ulceration, or gangrene due to PAD
- Diagnose clinically + physiologic tests + imaging for planning
- Treat with BMT + revascularization + wound/infection management
- Aim: limb salvage + reduce cardiovascular risk
