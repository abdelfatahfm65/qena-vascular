# Vascular Trauma

---

## Definition

> **Vascular trauma** refers to injury to arteries or veins resulting from **blunt or penetrating trauma**, leading to hemorrhage, ischemia, or both.

It is a **time-critical condition** where early recognition saves life and limb.

---

## Why it matters

Unrecognized vascular injury can result in:

- Massive hemorrhage
- Acute limb ischemia
- Compartment syndrome
- Limb loss
- Death

> ⚠️ Delay in diagnosis is a major cause of preventable morbidity.

---

## Mechanisms of injury

### 1️⃣ Penetrating trauma (most common)
- Stab wounds
- Gunshot injuries
- Iatrogenic injury

### 2️⃣ Blunt trauma
- Road traffic accidents
- Crush injuries
- Fractures & dislocations (especially knee & elbow)

---

## Commonly injured vessels

| Region | Vessel |
|------|-------|
| Neck | Carotid, vertebral |
| Upper limb | Brachial |
| Lower limb | Femoral, popliteal |
| Pelvis | Iliac vessels |

---

## Clinical assessment

### Primary survey (ATLS)
- **Control hemorrhage**
- Airway, breathing, circulation
- Apply direct pressure or tourniquet if needed

---

## Hard signs of vascular injury 🚨

Presence of **any one** → **immediate surgery**

- Active pulsatile bleeding
- Expanding or pulsatile hematoma
- Absent distal pulses
- Ischemia (5 Ps)
- Bruit or thrill over injury
- Shock not explained by other injuries

<Callout type="danger">
Hard signs = NO imaging. Go directly to the operating room.
</Callout>

---

## Soft signs of vascular injury ⚠️

Require further evaluation

- History of severe hemorrhage
- Diminished or asymmetric pulses
- Stable hematoma
- Nerve injury adjacent to vessel
- Proximity to major vessel

---

## Special injuries

### Knee dislocation
- High risk of **popliteal artery injury**
- Pulses may be initially present
- Requires **mandatory vascular assessment**

---

## Investigations

### If hard signs present
- **Immediate surgical exploration**

### If no hard signs
- **CT angiography (CTA)** – investigation of choice
- Duplex ultrasound (selected cases)

> ABI < **0.9** suggests vascular injury

---

## Management principles

### Initial management
- Hemorrhage control
- IV access & resuscitation
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics
- Tetanus prophylaxis

---

### Definitive management

#### Surgical options
- Primary repair
- End-to-end anastomosis
- Interposition graft (vein preferred)
- Ligation (selected veins)

#### Endovascular options
- Covered stents
- Embolization

---

## Damage control vascular surgery

Used in unstable patients:

- Temporary vascular shunt
- Control bleeding
- Definitive repair later

---

## Complications

- Thrombosis
- Infection
- Pseudoaneurysm
- Arteriovenous fistula
- Compartment syndrome

<Callout type="warning">
Always consider fasciotomy after revascularization if ischemia time > 6 hours.
</Callout>

---

## Key clinical pearls

- Hard signs = immediate surgery
- CTA is first-line in stable patients
- Popliteal artery injury can be occult
- Time to revascularization determines outcome

---

## Summary

- Vascular trauma is a surgical emergency
- Mechanism guides suspicion
- Hard signs mandate exploration
- Early intervention saves life and limb
