# Acute Limb Ischemia (ALI)


---

## Definition

> **Acute Limb Ischemia (ALI)** is a sudden decrease in arterial blood flow to a limb, resulting in tissue hypoxia and threatening limb viability if not treated urgently.

- Onset: **hours to days**
- This is a **vascular emergency**

---

## Why it matters

Acute limb ischemia can rapidly progress to **irreversible tissue damage**.

- Nerve injury may occur within **6 hours**
- Muscle necrosis follows shortly after
- Delay may lead to:
  - Limb loss
  - Rhabdomyolysis
  - Acute renal failure
  - Death

**Time is tissue.**

---

## Etiology and Pathophysiology

### Common causes
- **Arterial embolism** (most common)
- **In-situ thrombosis**
- Trauma
- Iatrogenic arterial injury
- Aortic dissection

Sudden arterial occlusion leaves **no time for collateral circulation**, leading to rapid tissue hypoxia.

---

## Clinical Presentation

### The classical *6 Ps*
- **Pain** – sudden and severe
- **Pallor**
- **Pulselessness**
- **Paresthesia**
- **Poikilothermia**
- **Paralysis** *(late and ominous sign)*

> ⚠️ Sensory or motor deficit indicates a **threatened limb**.

## Rutherford Classification

| Grade | Limb status | Sensory | Motor | Doppler |
|------|------------|--------|-------|--------|
| I | Viable | None | None | Arterial audible |
| IIa | Marginally threatened | Minimal | None | Inaudible |
| IIb | Immediately threatened | Sensory loss | Mild–moderate | Inaudible |
| III | Irreversible | Profound | Paralysis | None |

> **Grade IIb requires immediate revascularization.**

## Diagnosis

### Initial assessment
- ALI is primarily a **clinical diagnosis**
- Do **not delay treatment** for imaging if the limb is threatened


## Clinical examination (video)

### Imaging
- **CT angiography (CTA)** – first line if limb is viable
- **Duplex ultrasound** – bedside or unstable patients
- **Conventional angiography** – often diagnostic and therapeutic


---

## Management

### Immediate measures
- **IV unfractionated heparin**
- Adequate analgesia
- Limb kept dependent
- Oxygen and IV fluids

---

### Definitive treatment

#### Embolic occlusion
- Surgical embolectomy using **Fogarty catheter**

#### Thrombotic occlusion
- Catheter-directed thrombolysis
- Endovascular intervention
- Surgical bypass in selected cases

#### Irreversible ischemia (Grade III)
- **Primary amputation**
- Prevent systemic complications

---

## Complications
- Reperfusion injury
- Compartment syndrome
- Hyperkalemia
- Myoglobinuria → acute renal failure

---

## Key clinical pearls
- ALI is a **clinical emergency**
- Start **heparin immediately**
- Neurological deficit = limb threatened
- Do not delay revascularization for imaging

---

## Summary
- Acute limb ischemia is a vascular emergency
- Most common cause is embolism
- 6 Ps guide diagnosis
- Rutherford classification directs management
- Early intervention saves the limb
