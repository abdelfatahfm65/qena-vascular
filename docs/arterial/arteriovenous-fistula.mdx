# Arteriovenous Fistula (AVF)

---

## Definition

> **Arteriovenous fistula (AVF)** is an abnormal direct connection between an **artery and a vein**, bypassing the capillary bed.

This leads to:
- Increased venous pressure
- Reduced distal arterial perfusion
- Increased cardiac preload

---

## Why it matters

AVFs can cause serious local and systemic complications:

- **Distal limb ischemia (steal syndrome)**
- **Venous hypertension**
- **High-output cardiac failure**
- Progressive limb swelling and skin changes

> ⚠️ Large or untreated AVFs can be life-threatening.

---

## Classification

### 1️⃣ Congenital AVF
- Rare
- Often part of vascular malformations
- May present in childhood or early adulthood

### 2️⃣ Acquired AVF (most common)
- **Iatrogenic** (e.g. catheterization, dialysis access)
- **Traumatic** (penetrating or blunt injury)
- Post-surgical

---

## Common causes

- Femoral artery catheterization
- Hemodialysis access creation
- Penetrating trauma (stab, gunshot)
- Orthopedic or vascular surgery

---

## Pathophysiology

- Blood flows from **high-pressure artery → low-pressure vein**
- Results in:
  - Venous dilatation
  - Reduced distal arterial flow
  - Increased venous return → ↑ cardiac output

> Large AVFs may overwhelm the heart → **high-output heart failure**

---

## Clinical presentation

### Local signs
- Pulsatile mass
- **Continuous machinery murmur**
- Palpable thrill
- Limb swelling
- Dilated superficial veins

### Distal ischemia (Steal syndrome)
- Cold limb
- Pain
- Paresthesia
- Tissue loss (late)

### Systemic signs
- Tachycardia
- Cardiomegaly
- Signs of heart failure (advanced cases)

---

## Dialysis AVF

### Purpose
- Provides durable vascular access for hemodialysis

### Common sites
| Type | Location |
|----|--------|
| Radiocephalic | Wrist |
| Brachiocephalic | Elbow |
| Brachiobasilic | Upper arm |

## AVF complications (dialysis)

- Steal syndrome
- Thrombosis
- Infection
- Aneurysmal dilatation
- High-output heart failure

---

## Diagnosis

### Clinical
- Inspection + palpation
- Auscultation for bruit

### Imaging
- **Duplex ultrasound** – first line
- **CT angiography** – complex anatomy
- **Angiography** – diagnostic & therapeutic

---

## Management

### Conservative
- Small, asymptomatic AVFs
- Observation and follow-up

### Interventional
- **Endovascular embolization**
- Covered stent

### Surgical
- Ligation
- Resection with vessel repair
- Flow reduction procedures (dialysis AVF)

---

## Steal syndrome

> Occurs when AVF diverts blood away from distal limb.

### Management options
- Banding
- DRIL procedure
- AVF revision or ligation

<Callout type="warning">
Steal syndrome with tissue loss requires urgent intervention.
</Callout>

---

## Key clinical pearls

- Continuous bruit = AVF until proven otherwise
- Large AVF can cause **heart failure**
- Dialysis AVF is intentional — but still has complications
- Duplex ultrasound is the investigation of choice

---

## Summary

- AVF is an abnormal artery-to-vein connection
- Most are acquired and iatrogenic
- Can cause ischemia and heart failure
- Management depends on size, symptoms, and cause
