# Varicose Veins

---

## Definition

**Varicose veins** are **long, tortuous, dilated veins** of the **superficial venous system**, most commonly in the legs.

---

## Why do they happen?

Normally blood flows **from superficial → deep** veins through perforators.

When valves become **incompetent**, pressure increases in superficial veins → they become **dilated and tortuous**.

---

## Causes

### Primary (most common)
- Idiopathic / familial predisposition

### Secondary
- Pregnancy
- Previous DVT
- Pelvic mass / obstruction to venous outflow
- AV fistulae
- Klippel–Trénaunay syndrome

---

## Key anatomy (must-know)

- Two venous systems:
  - **Deep**
  - **Superficial**: **Long saphenous vein (LSV)** + **Short saphenous vein (SSV)**
- Superficial connects to deep via **perforators**
- **Sapheno-femoral junction (SFJ)**:
  - ~ **4 cm lateral** and **4 cm below** the pubic tubercle
- LSV: medial leg → SFJ  
- SSV: posterior/lateral calf → popliteal fossa

---

## History (what to ask)

- Symptoms:
  - aching / heavy legs (worse after standing, end of day)
  - swelling
  - skin itching / eczema
  - pain if thrombophlebitis
- Risk factors:
  - female sex, age, pregnancy, obesity, occupation (standing)
  - previous DVT
  - abdominal/pelvic symptoms (mass/obstruction)

---

## Examination

### Inspection (standing)
Look along:
- **LSV distribution** (medial leg)
- **SSV distribution** (posterior/lateral below knee)

Check “VVVLAPS”:
- Varicose veins distribution
- Venous ulcers / eczema
- Venous stars
- Lipodermatosclerosis
- Atrophy blanche
- Pitting edema
- Scars

### Palpation
- Confirm veins refill after gentle compression
- Find SFJ, check **saphena varix**
- **Cough test** at SFJ → thrill = incompetence
- **Tap test** (unreliable)

### Tourniquet tests
Goal: localize incompetent valves/perforators
- Trendelenburg / tourniquet test sequence down the leg

### Perthes test (deep system patency)
- Standing + mid-thigh tourniquet + calf pumps
- If veins empty → deep system OK
- If veins swell/pain → deep system obstruction suspected

---

## Doppler (classic teaching)
- At SFJ / SPJ:
  - 1 “whoosh” = normal
  - 2 “whoosh” = reflux / incompetence

---

## Investigations
- **Duplex ultrasonography** (gold standard mapping)
- Venography (rare)

---

## Management
### Conservative
- Reassurance
- Avoid prolonged standing
- Weight reduction
- Leg elevation
- Compression stockings

### Procedures (selected)
- Sclerotherapy
- Ligation of SFJ (Trendelenburg procedure)
- Stripping / phlebectomy of tributaries
