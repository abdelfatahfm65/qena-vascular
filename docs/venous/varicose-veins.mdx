# Varicose Veins

---

## Definition

**Varicose veins** are **long, tortuous, dilated veins** of the **superficial venous system**, most commonly in the legs.

---

## Why do they happen?

Normally blood flows **from superficial → deep** veins through perforators.

When valves become **incompetent**, pressure increases in superficial veins → they become **dilated and tortuous**.

---

## Causes

### Primary (most common)
- Idiopathic / familial predisposition

### Secondary
- Pregnancy
- Previous DVT
- Pelvic mass / obstruction to venous outflow
- AV fistulae
- Klippel–Trénaunay syndrome

---

## Key anatomy (must-know)

- Two venous systems:
  - **Deep**
  - **Superficial**: **Long saphenous vein (LSV)** + **Short saphenous vein (SSV)**
- Superficial connects to deep via **perforators**
- **Sapheno-femoral junction (SFJ)**:
  - ~ **4 cm lateral** and **4 cm below** the pubic tubercle
- LSV: medial leg → SFJ  
- SSV: posterior/lateral calf → popliteal fossa

---

## History (what to ask)

- Symptoms:
  - aching / heavy legs (worse after standing, end of day)
  - swelling
  - skin itching / eczema
  - pain if thrombophlebitis
- Risk factors:
  - female sex, age, pregnancy, obesity, occupation (standing)
  - previous DVT
  - abdominal/pelvic symptoms (mass/obstruction)

---

## Examination

### Inspection (standing)
Look along:
- **LSV distribution** (medial leg)
- **SSV distribution** (posterior/lateral below knee)

Check “VVVLAPS”:
- Varicose veins distribution
- Venous ulcers / eczema
- Venous stars
- Lipodermatosclerosis
- Atrophy blanche
- Pitting edema
- Scars

### Palpation
- Confirm veins refill after gentle compression
- Find SFJ, check **saphena varix**
- **Cough test** at SFJ → thrill = incompetence
- **Tap test** (unreliable)

### Tourniquet tests
Goal: localize incompetent valves/perforators
- Trendelenburg / tourniquet test sequence down the leg

### Perthes test (deep system patency)
- Standing + mid-thigh tourniquet + calf pumps
- If veins empty → deep system OK
- If veins swell/pain → deep system obstruction suspected

---

## Doppler (classic teaching)
- At SFJ / SPJ:
  - 1 “whoosh” = normal
  - 2 “whoosh” = reflux / incompetence

---

## Investigations
- **Duplex ultrasonography** (gold standard mapping)
- Venography (rare)

---

## Management (VV treatment)

### When to treat?
- **Symptoms** affecting daily life (pain, heaviness, swelling)
- **Complications**: eczema, lipodermatosclerosis, bleeding, superficial thrombophlebitis, venous ulcer
- **Cosmetic** concern (after counseling and mapping)

<Callout type="info" title="Rule before you treat">
Always confirm the pattern of reflux with **duplex mapping** (SFJ/SPJ, truncal reflux, perforators), and assess **deep system patency**—this guides the choice of procedure.
</Callout>

---

### 1) Conservative / medical (first step for many)
- Reassurance + explanation of benign vs complicated disease
- Avoid prolonged standing, regular walking/calf pump exercises
- Weight reduction
- Leg elevation
- **Compression stockings** (graduated):
  - Useful for symptom control and edema
  - Essential in venous ulcer care

> Conservative therapy improves symptoms but does **not** correct reflux permanently.

---

### 2) Interventional treatment (definitive)
**Best option depends on duplex findings** (truncal reflux vs tributaries vs perforators).

#### A) Endovenous ablation (modern first-line for truncal reflux)
- **Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA)**
- **Radiofrequency ablation (RFA)**

**Advantages**
- Minimally invasive (often under local/tumescent anesthesia)
- Rapid recovery, less postoperative pain than classic stripping

#### B) Non-thermal, non-tumescent techniques (recent modalities)
- **Cyanoacrylate closure (vein glue)**
  - No tumescent anesthesia; quick return to activity
- **Mechanochemical ablation (MOCA)**
  - Combines mechanical injury + sclerosant (no heat)
- (Less common/variable availability) **Steam ablation**

<Callout type="warning" title="Key idea">
For **truncal saphenous reflux**, current practice in many centers favors **endovenous techniques** (thermal or non-thermal) over classic open surgery when feasible.
</Callout>

#### C) Sclerotherapy (mainly for small veins / residual varicosities)
- **Liquid sclerotherapy**: telangiectasia / reticular veins
- **Ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS)**:
  - Useful for tributaries, recurrent varicosities, selected truncal reflux cases

#### D) Phlebectomy / tributary management
- **Ambulatory phlebectomy** (stab avulsions) for prominent tributaries
- Often combined with truncal ablation (“treat the source then tributaries”)

#### E) Surgery (classic teaching / selected cases)
- **High ligation at SFJ** (Trendelenburg) ± **stripping** of LSV
- **SPJ ligation** ± SSV procedures (careful anatomy)
- Used when endovenous is not suitable/available, or in complex anatomy

#### F) Perforator / ulcer-related disease (selected)
- Address perforator reflux if significant and linked to ulcer/non-healing
- **SEPS** (subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery) in selected cases

---

### Post-procedure care (practical)
- Early ambulation (reduces DVT risk)
- Compression as advised by the treating team
- Follow-up **duplex** when indicated (especially in recurrence/symptoms)

---

### Common complications (brief)
- Bruising, pain, thrombophlebitis
- Skin staining (after sclerotherapy)
- Nerve irritation (especially around SSV)
- DVT (uncommon but important)
