# Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)

---

## Pathophysiology (Virchow triad)

DVT develops due to:
1) **Abnormal blood flow** (stasis)  
2) **Abnormal blood** (hypercoagulability)  
3) **Vascular injury**

---

## Risk factors

- Age > 40
- Malignancy
- Obesity
- Varicose veins
- Previous DVT/PE (personal or family)
- Surgery > 30 minutes (esp. ortho/neuro/urology/gyne)
- Immobility / paralysis / recent stroke
- OCP / HRT
- Pregnancy & puerperium
- Severe illness (HF, MI, sepsis, IBD)
- Thrombophilia

---

## Clinical features

- Calf pain/tenderness
- Swelling + pitting edema
- Distal DVT: swelling below knee  
- Proximal DVT: swelling up to groin
- Increased skin temperature
- Superficial venous dilatation
- Cyanosis in severe obstruction (phlegmasia cerulea dolens)
- Homans’ sign (pain on passive dorsiflexion) *(not reliable)*

---

## Investigations

### D-dimer
- Useful adjunct (high sensitivity)
- High negative predictive value (helps rule out when low suspicion)

### Thrombophilia testing (when indicated)
- Idiopathic VTE and age < 50
- Recurrent VTE
- Family history of idiopathic/recurrent VTE  
Examples:
- Protein C/S, Antithrombin III
- Antiphospholipid antibodies
- Factor V Leiden / APC resistance
- Prothrombin gene mutation (G20210A)
- Homocysteine  
> Do before anticoagulation if possible.

### Imaging
- **Doppler ultrasound**
  - Good for proximal DVT
  - Less reliable for distal DVT
- **Contrast venography** (rare; invasive)
- CTV / MRV (selected cases)

---

## Complications

- **Pulmonary embolism (PE)** (most serious)
- **Post-thrombotic syndrome**
- Recurrence

---

## Prevention

- Early mobilization
- Graduated compression stockings
- Pneumatic compression devices (peri-op / selected medical patients)
- Low-dose heparin prophylaxis / LMWH in high-risk settings

---

## Treatment (overview)

- Elevation + early mobilization (as appropriate)
- **Anticoagulation**
  - UFH bolus then infusion (or LMWH)
  - Transition to oral anticoagulant with overlap when needed
- Duration varies by cause:
  - transient cause: ~3 months
  - idiopathic: 3–6 months
  - malignancy/ongoing risk: 6–12 months
  - recurrent VTE: often longer

### Anticoagulants (detailed)

Anticoagulation is the **mainstay** of DVT treatment. Options are divided into:
- **Parenteral anticoagulants** (IV/SC)
- **Oral anticoagulants** (including **new oral anticoagulants / DOACs**)

<Callout type="info" title="Practical approach (typical pathways)">
- Many patients can start directly on a **DOAC** (e.g., apixaban or rivaroxaban).  
- Others start with **heparin (UFH/LMWH)** then transition to an oral agent (e.g., warfarin or DOAC depending on indication).
</Callout>

---

### 1) Parenteral anticoagulants (IV/SC)

#### A) Unfractionated heparin (UFH) — IV
- **Rapid onset/offset** (preferred when quick reversal may be needed)
- Useful in:
  - High bleeding risk where you want short half-life
  - Severe renal impairment (often preferred over LMWH)
  - When procedures/thrombolysis may be needed
- Requires **aPTT monitoring** (or anti-Xa in some settings)

#### B) Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) — SC
Examples: **enoxaparin, dalteparin**
- Predictable dosing, usually **no routine monitoring**
- Commonly used for initial treatment and outpatient management
- Preferred in many cases of **cancer-associated thrombosis** (depending on local protocol)

#### C) Fondaparinux — SC
- Indirect factor Xa inhibitor
- Option for initial therapy (selected patients)
- Avoid/adjust in renal impairment (protocol dependent)

---

### 2) Oral anticoagulants

#### A) Vitamin K antagonist (VKA): Warfarin
- Requires **INR monitoring** (target often **2–3**)
- Needs **bridging/overlap** initially:
  - Start warfarin + **UFH/LMWH** for at least ~5 days
  - Continue overlap until INR therapeutic (per protocol)
- Many drug/food interactions

<Callout type="warning" title="Why overlap with heparin?">
Warfarin has a delayed onset and can transiently reduce protein C/S early, so bridging avoids early hypercoagulability and ensures immediate anticoagulation.
</Callout>

---

### 3) New Oral Anticoagulants (NOACs) / DOACs

**DOACs** = direct oral anticoagulants (often preferred due to ease of use).
- **Factor Xa inhibitors:** **apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban**
- **Direct thrombin inhibitor:** **dabigatran**

**Key points**
- Fixed dosing, **no routine INR monitoring**
- Fewer interactions than warfarin
- Renal function matters (dose adjustment/avoid in severe renal failure depending on drug)

#### “Start-up” patterns (common)
- **Apixaban / Rivaroxaban:** can be started **immediately** (no heparin lead-in in many protocols)
- **Dabigatran / Edoxaban:** usually require **5–10 days of parenteral anticoagulation first** (UFH/LMWH) before switching

---

### Advanced / special
- Thrombolysis: massive iliofemoral thrombosis with limb compromise
- Surgical thrombectomy: rare, life-threatening cases
- IVC filter: selected cases (reduces PE risk but not other complications)
