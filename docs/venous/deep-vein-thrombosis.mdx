# Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)

---

## Pathophysiology (Virchow triad)

DVT develops due to:
1) **Abnormal blood flow** (stasis)  
2) **Abnormal blood** (hypercoagulability)  
3) **Vascular injury**

---

## Risk factors

- Age > 40
- Malignancy
- Obesity
- Varicose veins
- Previous DVT/PE (personal or family)
- Surgery > 30 minutes (esp. ortho/neuro/urology/gyne)
- Immobility / paralysis / recent stroke
- OCP / HRT
- Pregnancy & puerperium
- Severe illness (HF, MI, sepsis, IBD)
- Thrombophilia

---

## Clinical features

- Calf pain/tenderness
- Swelling + pitting edema
- Distal DVT: swelling below knee  
- Proximal DVT: swelling up to groin
- Increased skin temperature
- Superficial venous dilatation
- Cyanosis in severe obstruction (phlegmasia cerulea dolens)
- Homans’ sign (pain on passive dorsiflexion) *(not reliable)*

---

## Investigations

### D-dimer
- Useful adjunct (high sensitivity)
- High negative predictive value (helps rule out when low suspicion)

### Thrombophilia testing (when indicated)
- Idiopathic VTE and age < 50
- Recurrent VTE
- Family history of idiopathic/recurrent VTE  
Examples:
- Protein C/S, Antithrombin III
- Antiphospholipid antibodies
- Factor V Leiden / APC resistance
- Prothrombin gene mutation (G20210A)
- Homocysteine  
> Do before anticoagulation if possible.

### Imaging
- **Doppler ultrasound**
  - Good for proximal DVT
  - Less reliable for distal DVT
- **Contrast venography** (rare; invasive)
- CTV / MRV (selected cases)

---

## Complications

- **Pulmonary embolism (PE)** (most serious)
- **Post-thrombotic syndrome**
- Recurrence

---

## Prevention

- Early mobilization
- Graduated compression stockings
- Pneumatic compression devices (peri-op / selected medical patients)
- Low-dose heparin prophylaxis / LMWH in high-risk settings

---

## Treatment (overview)

- Elevation + early mobilization (as appropriate)
- **Anticoagulation**
  - UFH bolus then infusion (or LMWH)
  - Transition to oral anticoagulant with overlap when needed
- Duration varies by cause:
  - transient cause: ~3 months
  - idiopathic: 3–6 months
  - malignancy/ongoing risk: 6–12 months
  - recurrent VTE: often longer

### Advanced / special
- Thrombolysis: massive iliofemoral thrombosis with limb compromise
- Surgical thrombectomy: rare, life-threatening cases
- IVC filter: selected cases (reduces PE risk but not other complications)
